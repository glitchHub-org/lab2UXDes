            <div class="card-body">Our world is now facing a huge problem regarding excessive wastes that ends up in our oceans, causing harm to our marine animals, as well as creatures in land. It is a wake-up call for us to do something about it, since this is our only home. One of the biggest contributors in waste is plastic. A single plastic takes 450-1000 years to decompose, and every year, we produce 300 million tons of plastic. One way to solve our plastic waste problem is by making an EcoBrick. An EcoBrick uses 1.5 liter of bottle, filled with different plastic trashes. Plastics are cut into pieces to fill the bottle until it gets hard like a real brick. EcoBricks are used to build houses as an alternative to hollow blocks. Though it’s not a perfect solution to get rid of all the plastic wastes around the globe, but it somehow reduces the number of plastics that ends up in the ocean. Everyone is encouraged to make at least one, because we need to immediately solve this problem before it’s too late.
	Problems encountered usually by EcoBricks maker are they don’t know how to do it correctly and where to donate it. As an observation from one of our team members, she noticed the incorrect way of filling up the bottles. Her parents don’t cut the plastics, rather they just twist it in, which might cause a problem afterwards or in the future. They will be having a hard time filling every space in the bottle for it to get hard, and if the bottle is not as hard as a brick, it might cause problem in the construction of a building. To prevent that scenario, we thought of creating an application that demonstrates the right way of making an EcoBrick through videos and pictures. Also, to solve the other problem regarding places for donation, the application will also show nearby places where they can donate their EcoBricks. They will put the number of their donations for the knowledge of the user on how much EcoBricks they already contribute. The other option we considered was making an application that encourages people to properly dispose their waste and make at least one EcoBrick to solve plastic pollution. The reason why we chose the app that demonstrates how to make an EcoBrick and where to donate it is because we want to focus on people who already have a plan to make one and who are struggling to make it and where to donate it. We thought of having a hard time to achieve our goal to encourage everyone to make an EcoBrick since I already saw a lot of pages that advocates about it. If we create an app that is about EcoBrick, we already have a specific market to target.

          <div class="card-footer">
          Problems:
-Increasing environmental problem regarding improper plastic waste disposal
-Most of the plastics end up in the ocean, causing harm to marine animals
-Plastics also causes floods because of incorrect disposal of trashes that got stuck in the drainage system
-Most of the people doesn't know how to make EcoBrick in the right way
- Some people doesn't know where to donate their EcoBricks
Solution:
-Make an application that shows video and pictures on how to make an EcoBrick
-It shows nearby places where they can donate their EcoBricks
-Donors will be informed where their donations are used
